# PacMen Factory Excercise

# Description 
With this project, a user can add PacMen to the webpage with a click of the botton. Simply click the "Add PacMan" button, followed by the "Start Game" button, then watch as the PacMen bounce across the screen at their own pace.

# How to Run
First download the PacMan Factory repository. Then drag and drop the index.html file onto a blank page. Next you will see the page with two buttons and no PacMen. Press the "Add PacMan" button, followed by the "Start Game" button.

# Roadmap
An inprovement I would like to make in the future would be to have the PacMen open and close their mouth.
